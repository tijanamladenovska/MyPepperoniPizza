# MyPepperoniPizza

This project uses Pythonâ€™s `turtle` graphics library to draw a pizza illustration. It was created as part of a LinkedIn Learning course where I explored the fundamentals of Python programming.

The goal of the project wasnâ€™t just to make something fun and visual, but also to practice core programming concepts like:

* Working with Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries
* Understanding functions and loops
* Using graphics for creative problem solving

ðŸŽ¯ Why this project?

Sometimes the best way to learn programming is by turning code into something visual. This way you get all learning concepts on a plate, ready to be consumed.

ðŸš€ How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python pizza.py
   ```

ðŸŒ± Next steps

I might expand this project to include:

* Different toppings (extra cheese, anyone?)
* Interactive elements (choose your pizza style)
* More experiments with `turtle` graphics

Feel free to use this code as a base to experiment and design your own pizza creations. ðŸ˜‹
